In version 2.4 we will raise an exception if use_reentrant is not passed. use_reentrant=False is recommended, but if you need to preserve the current default behavior, you can pass use_reentrant=True. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.
  return fn(*args, **kwargs)
The input hidden states seems to be silently casted in float32, this might be related to the fact you have upcasted embedding or layer norm layers in float32. We will cast back the input in torch.float16.
